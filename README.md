IOT-MotionDetector

IOT- Motion detector using a camera/phone connected to the laptop with arduino PIR sensor to sense the motion, when the motion is sensed the arduino sends a signal to the camera and the camera looks for a face. Once it captures a face it sends the data to UBIDOTS Cloud service and a notification to the phone through a Telegram bot with the picture of the face of the person.
